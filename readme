1. HTML Structure:
The page includes a <textarea> where users can input text.
A <button> triggers the speech function when clicked.
The elements are wrapped inside a <div> with a container class for styling.
2. CSS (External - style.css):
The external CSS file (style.css) is linked in the <head>, but its contents are not provided.
Likely used for styling the container, button, and textarea.
3. JavaScript (texttospeech() Function):
Retrieves the text from the <textarea> using document.getElementById("textToSpeak").
Creates a SpeechSynthesisUtterance object (speechObj) with the text.
Calls window.speechSynthesis.speak(speechObj), which uses the browser's built-in Web Speech API to convert text to speech.
4. SpeechSynthesis API:
SpeechSynthesisUtterance: Represents the text-to-speech request.
window.speechSynthesis.speak(obj): Reads the text aloud using the system's default voice.
